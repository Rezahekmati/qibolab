Platforms
=========

Qibolab provides support to different quantum laboratories.

Each lab is implemented using a :class:`qibolab.platform.Platform` object which implements basic features and connects instruments, qubits and channels.
Therefore, the ``Platform`` enables the user to interface with all
the required lab instruments at the same time with minimum effort.
